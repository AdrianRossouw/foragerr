"""The single outbound HTTP client factory (FRG-NFR-006, FRG-SEC-001).

Design (m1-foundation, decision 9): every outbound ``httpx.AsyncClient`` in
foragerr is built here — the one choke point where timeouts, TLS
verification, redirect bounds, response-size bounds, egress policy, and log
redaction are all enforced. The static-guard test keeps any other
``httpx``/``requests`` call site out of ``backend/src``.

Guarantees on every client this factory produces:

- explicit connect / read / write / pool timeouts from settings — nothing is
  ever unlimited;
- TLS certificate verification always on; the factory API deliberately
  exposes NO per-call or per-host opt-out parameter;
- ``follow_redirects=False`` — redirects are walked manually by
  :meth:`OutboundClient.request`, bounded at :data:`MAX_REDIRECTS` hops, and
  every hop (including the initial request) is re-validated by the egress
  policy (:mod:`foragerr.http.egress`);
- response bodies are streamed with a byte cap: oversize bodies — including
  servers that omit or lie in ``Content-Length`` — abort the read with a
  bounded error, never accumulate an unbounded buffer, and never hand a
  partial body to the caller;
- credentials/cookies supplied for the originating request are NOT forwarded
  to redirect hosts outside the original host (FRG-SEC-001);
- any URL logged or embedded in an error by this module passes through
  :func:`foragerr.logging.redact` first (FRG-NFR-008).

How later areas obtain clients
------------------------------
Build one :class:`HttpClientFactory` from settings at app startup, then:

- ``factory.external()`` — default profile for any host derived from
  external or config-supplied input (ComicVine, indexers, DDL, images);
  the full SSRF egress policy applies to every hop.
- ``factory.local_service(base_url)`` — for an integration whose base URL
  the operator configured explicitly (e.g. SABnzbd at
  ``settings.sabnzbd_url`` on a LAN address, field added by the DL change);
  that exact base-URL origin is allowed, everything else still gets the
  external policy.

Residual risk — DNS-rebinding TOCTOU: see :mod:`foragerr.http.egress`
(resolve-then-connect window, accepted residual per RISK-025).
